## What is Ralph Orchestrator?

Ralph Orchestrator is a functional, early-stage (alpha) implementation of the **Ralph Wiggum orchestration technique** - a simple but powerful pattern for autonomous AI task completion. As [Geoffrey Huntley](https://ghuntley.com/ralph/) originally defined it: **"Ralph is a Bash loop"** that continuously runs an AI agent against a prompt file until the task is marked as complete or limits are reached.

Based on Huntley's technique, this implementation adds practical safety, monitoring, and cost controls for real-world usage. It works today, but expect rough edges and occasional breaking API/config changes between releases. For Claude Code users, also see the official [ralph-wiggum plugin](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/tree/main/plugins/ralph-wiggum).

## Quick Example

```bash
# 1. Create a task prompt
cat > PROMPT.md << EOF
Create a Python function that calculates the Fibonacci sequence.
Include proper documentation and unit tests.
The orchestrator will iterate until the function is complete.
EOF

# 2. Run Ralph
python ralph_orchestrator.py --prompt PROMPT.md

# 3. Ralph iterates until the task is done!
```

## Why Ralph Orchestrator?

### The Problem
Modern AI agents are powerful but require supervision. They can lose context, make mistakes, or need multiple iterations to complete complex tasks. Manual supervision is time-consuming and error-prone.

### The Solution
Ralph Orchestrator automates the iteration loop while maintaining safety and control:

- **Autonomous Operation**: Set it and forget it - Ralph handles the iterations
- **Safety First**: Built-in limits prevent runaway costs and infinite loops
- **Alpha-Quality**: Solid capabilities, with APIs/config still evolving
- **Observable**: Detailed metrics and logging for debugging and optimization
- **Recoverable**: Checkpoint system allows resuming from any point

## Use Cases

Ralph Orchestrator excels at:

- **Code Generation**: Building features, fixing bugs, writing tests
- **Documentation**: Creating comprehensive docs, API references, tutorials
- **Data Processing**: ETL pipelines, data analysis, report generation
- **Automation**: CI/CD setup, deployment scripts, infrastructure as code
- **Research**: Information gathering, summarization, analysis
