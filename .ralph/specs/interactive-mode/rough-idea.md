# Rough Idea: Interactive TUI Mode

## Original Request

Update interactive mode such that it always runs in a TUI (Terminal User Interface) with the CLI output in its own interactive pane, similar to Zellij's pane-based terminal multiplexer approach.

## Initial Concept

- Transform Ralph's interactive mode from a simple CLI into a full TUI experience
- CLI output should be displayed in a dedicated, interactive pane
- The interface should feel similar to Zellij's pane management
- Users should be able to interact with both the orchestrator and see real-time CLI output
