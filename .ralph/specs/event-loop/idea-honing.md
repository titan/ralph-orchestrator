# Idea Honing

Requirements clarification for the resilient, extensible event loop with hat collections.

---

## Q1: What's the core architectural change you're envisioning?

**Answer:**

The shift is from "Ralph wears different hats" to "Ralph delegates to hat-wearing agents":

**Current design (brittle):**
- Planner and Builder are both "Ralph with a hat"
- Users can override/replace these hats
- This breaks the event graph (events published with no subscriber)
- Ralph can "forget" things

**Proposed design (resilient):**
- Single, irreplaceable "hatless Ralph" — the classic Ralph Wiggum technique
- Hatless Ralph is always present as the orchestrator/manager/scrum master
- Additional hats are optional extensions that Ralph can **delegate to**
- Users ADD hats, they don't REPLACE core Ralph
- Ralph coordinates; hats execute

**Key insight:** Ralph becomes the constant, the orchestrator. Hats become his team.

**Evidence from presets:**
- `review.yml`: `reviewer` triggers on `task.start` — no planner, coordination embedded in reviewer
- `feature.yml`: `planner` is just another replaceable hat
- Each preset rebuilds coordination from scratch
- No safety net for orphaned events

**Root cause:** Coordination is embedded in hats, not separated from them.

---

## Q2: How should hatless Ralph work in practice?

**Answer:**

The existing pub/sub event system stays — hats can still trigger other hats directly (e.g., researcher → reviewer). But hatless Ralph is always **the ruler**.

**Mental model: Constitutional Monarchy**
```
                    ┌─────────────────────────┐
                    │   👑 HATLESS RALPH      │
                    │   (The Ruler)           │
                    │   - Always present      │
                    │   - Ultimate authority  │
                    │   - Oversees everything │
                    └───────────┬─────────────┘
                                │ oversees
        ┌───────────────────────┼───────────────────────┐
        ▼                       ▼                       ▼
   ┌─────────┐             ┌─────────┐            ┌─────────┐
   │ Builder │────event───►│ Reviewer│───event───►│ Deployer│
   └─────────┘             └─────────┘            └─────────┘
        ▲                                              │
        └──────────────────event───────────────────────┘
```

- Hats can still communicate directly via pub/sub
- Users define triggers/publishes as before
- BUT: Ralph is always the sovereign — he rules

---

## Q3: What powers does the ruler have?

**Answer:**

| Power | Has It? | Notes |
|-------|---------|-------|
| **Catches orphaned events** | ✅ Yes | Safety net — no dead ends |
| **Owns completion** | ✅ Yes | Only Ralph can output `LOOP_COMPLETE` |
| **Owns the scratchpad** | ✅ Yes | Ralph creates/maintains; hats read/update |
| **Fallback executor** | ✅ Yes | No hats? Ralph does it himself |
| **Veto power** | ❌ No | Direct hat-to-hat invocation bypasses Ralph |
| **Always runs last** | ✅ Yes | Ralph closes every cycle |

**Key constraints:**
- No veto power — direct hat-to-hat pub/sub bypasses Ralph entirely
- Ralph always runs **last** — he's the closer, not the opener
- Ralph **must** output the completion promise
- Ralph **must** output the final event topic signifying loop complete

**Mental model shift:** Ralph isn't intercepting traffic; he's the final checkpoint.

---

## Q4: When does Ralph run?

**Answer: Option B — When no hat is triggered**

```
hat₁ → hat₂ → hat₃ → (no subscriber for event) → 👑 Ralph runs
```

**Tenet alignment:**
- **Tenet 2 (Backpressure Over Prescription):** Ralph doesn't prescribe when to return; he catches what falls through
- **Tenet 5 (Steer With Signals):** "No subscriber" IS the signal that triggers Ralph
- **Tenet 6 (Let Ralph Ralph):** Hats work autonomously; Ralph only steps in when the chain ends

**Why this is least brittle:**
- Orphaned events don't dead-end — they fall through to Ralph
- No prescription for hats to "hand back" (which they might forget)
- Ralph is the universal fallback, not a micromanager
- The safety net is implicit in the architecture, not explicit in instructions

**Key insight:** Ralph subscribes to `*` (everything), but hat subscriptions take priority. Ralph only activates when no hat claims the event.

---

## Q5: What happens when Ralph runs?

**Answer:**

```
Ralph receives unclaimed event (or no event on first run)
    │
    ├─► "Is there a hat that SHOULD handle this?"
    │       │
    │       ├─► YES: Delegate to that hat
    │       │        (dispatch event that triggers the hat)
    │       │
    │       └─► NO: Handle it myself
    │
    ├─► Update scratchpad with status
    │
    └─► "Is all work complete?"
            │
            ├─► YES: Output LOOP_COMPLETE + final event
            │
            └─► NO: Dispatch next priority task (to hat or self)
```

**Key requirement:** Ralph must know what hats are available and what they do — hat topology must be injected into Ralph's context.

**Two modes:**
1. **Delegate** — There's a hat for this, dispatch to it
2. **Do it himself** — No suitable hat, Ralph handles it directly (classic single-agent mode)

---

## Q6: How does Ralph know what hats are available?

**Answer:**

Hat topology is loaded from the YAML config and injected into Ralph's prompt when hats are configured.

**Flow:**
```
ralph.yml (or preset)
    │
    ├─► hats:
    │     builder: { triggers: [...], publishes: [...], ... }
    │     reviewer: { triggers: [...], publishes: [...], ... }
    │
    ▼
Orchestrator reads config
    │
    ▼
Builds hat topology table
    │
    ▼
Injects into Ralph's prompt:

    ## Available Hats

    | Hat | Triggers On | Publishes | Description |
    |-----|-------------|-----------|-------------|
    | builder | `build.task` | `build.done`, `build.blocked` | Implements code |
    | reviewer | `review.request` | `review.approved`, `review.changes_requested` | Reviews code |

    ## To Delegate
    Publish an event that triggers the hat you want.
```

**Key points:**
- Configuration-driven, not dynamic discovery
- Ralph knows exactly what's available based on what user defined
- No hats configured = no table injected = Ralph does everything himself

---

## Q7: What does Ralph's default prompt look like?

**Answer:**

Ralph's prompt should reflect the Ralph Wiggum philosophy:
- Simple, not clever
- Trust iteration over prescription
- Backpressure enforces correctness
- The plan on disk is memory; fresh context is reliability

**Core prompt (always present):**

```markdown
I'm Ralph. Fresh context, fresh start. The scratchpad is my memory.

## ALWAYS
- Read `.agent/scratchpad.md` — it's the plan, it's the state, it's the truth
- Search before assuming — the codebase IS the instruction manual
- Backpressure is law — tests, typecheck, lint must pass
- One task, one commit — keep it atomic

## DONE?
All tasks `[x]` or `[~]`? Output: LOOP_COMPLETE
```

**Conditional injection — Solo mode (no hats):**

```markdown
## SOLO MODE
No team today. I do the work myself.
Pick the highest priority `[ ]` task and get it done.
```

**Conditional injection — Multi-hat mode (hats configured):**

```markdown
## MY TEAM
I've got hats to delegate to. Use them.

| Hat | Triggers On | Publishes | What They Do |
|-----|-------------|-----------|--------------|
| builder | `build.task` | `build.done`, `build.blocked` | Implements code |
| reviewer | `review.request` | `review.approved`, `review.changes_requested` | Reviews code |

To delegate: publish an event that triggers the hat.
If no hat fits: do it myself.
```

**Key changes from previous draft:**
- Simpler, more Ralph-like tone ("I'm Ralph" not "You are Ralph")
- Solo/multi-hat sections are conditional, not always present
- Removed verbose "YOUR JOB" section — Ralph knows what to do
- Trust the iteration, don't over-explain

---

## Q8: How can we make event publishing more resilient?

**Answer:**

Instead of parsing XML event tags from agent response text, use **disk state**:

**Current (brittle):**
```
Agent output text → Regex parse for <event topic="..."> → Hope it's there
```

**Proposed (resilient):**
```
Agent writes to .agent/events.jsonl → Orchestrator reads file → Route event
```

**Why this is better:**
- **Tenet 4 (Disk Is State):** We already use disk for scratchpad — events are the same pattern
- **Structured data:** JSONL is unambiguous; no regex parsing of free-form text
- **Observable:** Event file is a debug artifact — you can `cat` it to see what happened
- **Backpressure:** If file isn't written or malformed, we catch it cleanly

**Event file format:**
```jsonl
{"topic": "build.done", "payload": "Implemented auth endpoint", "ts": "2024-01-15T10:24:12Z"}
```

**Routing flow:**
```
Hat completes iteration
    │
    ├─► Read .agent/events.jsonl (new entries since last read)
    │       │
    │       ├─► Event(s) found → Route to subscriber (or Ralph if none)
    │       │
    │       └─► No new events → Falls through to Ralph
```

**Bonus:** This unifies event publishing with event history — same file, same format, single source of truth.

**Additional resilience: `default_publishes`**

Each hat can specify a default event to publish if no explicit event is written:

```yaml
hats:
  builder:
    triggers: ["build.task"]
    publishes: ["build.done", "build.blocked"]
    default_publishes: "build.done"  # ← If no event written, assume this
```

**Routing flow with default:**
```
Hat completes iteration
    │
    ├─► Explicit event in .agent/events.jsonl? → Route it
    │
    ├─► No explicit event + hat has default_publishes? → Route default
    │
    └─► No explicit event + no default? → Falls through to Ralph
```

This means a well-configured hat can never accidentally stall the loop — worst case, the default event fires.

---

## Q9: How do presets change under this model?

**Answer:**

Break cleanly from the old `planner` pattern. Ralph is implicit.

**New preset structure:**
```yaml
# Ralph is implicit — always present, can't be configured away

hats:
  builder:
    triggers: ["build.task"]
    publishes: ["build.done", "build.blocked"]
    default_publishes: "build.done"
    instructions: "..."
```

**Suggestions for other preset improvements:**

| Current Pattern | Problem | Proposed Change |
|-----------------|---------|-----------------|
| **Per-preset completion promises** (`RESEARCH_COMPLETE`, `DEBUG_COMPLETE`, etc.) | Inconsistent, confusing | Standardize on `LOOP_COMPLETE` — Ralph always uses the same signal |
| **Event naming inconsistency** (`build.task` vs `hypothesis.test` vs `research.finding`) | Hard to remember conventions | Standardize: `<domain>.<action>` (e.g., `build.start`, `review.request`) |
| **Duplicated hat instructions** | Builder instructions copy-pasted across presets | Base hats library — presets reference, don't redefine |
| **Hardcoded backpressure** (`cargo check && cargo test`) | Rust-specific, not portable | Configurable `backpressure_commands` in config |
| **Varying scratchpad formats** | Each preset invents its own | Ralph owns scratchpad format — hats read/update, don't reinvent |

**Base hats library concept:**
```yaml
# presets/feature.yml
hats:
  builder: "@base/builder"      # ← Reference base definition
  reviewer: "@base/reviewer"    # ← Reference base definition

  custom_hat:                   # ← Preset-specific hat
    triggers: ["custom.event"]
    ...
```

---

## Q10: What other improvements should we consider?

**Answer: KISS**

| Question | Answer |
|----------|--------|
| Iteration model | One iteration = one agent invocation. No change. |
| Cost/context for Ralph | Doesn't matter for now. Keep it simple. |
| Parallel hats | Sequential. KISS. |
| Hat lifecycle | Fixed at startup. KISS. |

**Philosophy check:** ✅ Aligned with Ralph Wiggum — don't over-engineer, trust iteration.

---

## Summary of Requirements

### Core Architecture Change

**From:** Ralph wears different hats (planner, builder can be overwritten)
**To:** Hatless Ralph is the constant sovereign; hats are his delegatable team

### Hatless Ralph (The Ruler)

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Always present | ✅ Can never be replaced or configured away |
| Owns scratchpad | ✅ Creates, maintains `.agent/scratchpad.md` |
| Owns completion | ✅ Only Ralph outputs `LOOP_COMPLETE` |
| Universal fallback | ✅ Catches all unhandled events |
| Runs when | No hat claims the event (chain ends) |
| No veto power | ❌ Direct hat-to-hat pub/sub bypasses Ralph |

### Event System Changes

| Change | Details |
|--------|---------|
| Publishing mechanism | JSONL on disk (`.agent/events.jsonl`) instead of XML parsing |
| Default events | `default_publishes` per hat — fallback if no explicit event |
| Routing priority | 1) Explicit event → 2) Default event → 3) Ralph fallback |

### Preset Changes

| Change | Details |
|--------|---------|
| No more `planner` hat | Ralph IS the planner; break cleanly |
| Base hats library | `"@base/builder"` references instead of duplication |
| Single completion promise | Always `LOOP_COMPLETE` |
| Standardized event naming | `<domain>.<action>` convention |

### Per-Hat Backend Configuration

| Change | Details |
|--------|---------|
| Named backends | `backend: "claude"` — simple, uses standard config |
| Kiro agents | `backend: { type: "kiro", agent: "builder" }` — MCP tools, custom model |
| Custom backends | `backend: { command: "...", args: [...] }` — any CLI tool |
| Inheritance | Hat without `backend` inherits from `cli.backend` |

### E2E Testing

| Change | Details |
|--------|---------|
| Scripted scenarios | YAML files defining iteration-by-iteration behavior |
| Mock CLI | Simulates `claude -p` invocations with deterministic responses |
| Assertions | Verify completion, iteration count, file state, event routing |

### KISS Constraints

- One iteration = one agent invocation
- Sequential hats only (no parallel delegation)
- Hats fixed at startup
- Don't optimize Ralph's model/cost yet

## Q11: How will we perform E2E integration testing?

**Answer: Scripted scenarios with mock CLI**

Mock real `claude -p` invocations with scripted, deterministic responses.

│  Behaves like `claude -p "prompt"`:                              │
│  - Accepts prompt via -p flag                                    │
│  - Writes to disk (scratchpad, events.jsonl)                     │
│  - Returns scripted output                                       │
│  - Scripted per-iteration responses                              │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Scenario format:**

```yaml
# test-scenarios/orphaned-event-fallback.yml
name: "Orphaned event falls through to Ralph"
config:
  hats:
    builder:
      triggers: ["build.task"]
      publishes: ["build.done"]

iterations:
  # Iteration 1: Ralph delegates to builder
  - hat: ralph
    writes:
      events:
        - { topic: "build.task", payload: "Implement auth" }

  # Iteration 2: Builder completes, publishes unknown event
  - hat: builder
    writes:
      events:
        - { topic: "unknown.event", payload: "Something weird" }

  # Iteration 3: Unknown event falls through to Ralph
  - hat: ralph  # ← Verify Ralph catches it
    writes:
      scratchpad: |
        ## Tasks
        - [x] Implement auth
      events: []

expect:
  completion: true
  iterations: 3
```

**Scenarios to cover:**

| Scenario | What It Validates |
|----------|-------------------|
| Solo mode completion | Ralph works alone, no hats |
| Multi-hat delegation | Ralph → hat → Ralph closes |
| Orphaned event fallback | Unknown event falls to Ralph |
| JSONL event parsing | Events read from `.agent/events.jsonl` |
| Default publishes | Hat forgets event, `default_publishes` fires |
| Scratchpad ownership | Ralph creates/maintains scratchpad |
| Hat-to-hat direct | Builder → Reviewer bypasses Ralph |
| Completion only from Ralph | Hat outputs `LOOP_COMPLETE`, ignored |

**Mock CLI implementation:**

```rust
// Mock backend that reads scripted responses
pub struct MockCliBackend {
    scenario: Scenario,
    iteration: usize,
}

impl CliBackend for MockCliBackend {
    fn invoke(&mut self, prompt: &str) -> Result<String> {
        let response = self.scenario.iterations[self.iteration].clone();
        self.iteration += 1;

        // Write scripted files to disk
        if let Some(scratchpad) = &response.writes.scratchpad {
            fs::write(".agent/scratchpad.md", scratchpad)?;
        }
        if !response.writes.events.is_empty() {
            // Append to events.jsonl
        }

        Ok(response.output)
    }
}
```

## Q12: How can hats be tied to specific agent configurations?

**Context:**

Currently all hats share one global backend (`cli.backend`). This limits flexibility because different agents have different strengths:

| Agent | Strengths |
|-------|-----------|
| Claude | Coding, reasoning, long context |
| Kiro | AWS MCP tools, internal wiki access |
| Gemini | Different perspective, fast |
| Codex | OpenAI ecosystem |

**Proposed: Per-Hat Backend**

```yaml
cli:
  backend: "claude"  # Default for Ralph + hats that don't specify

hats:
  builder:
    triggers: ["build.task"]
    backend: "claude"       # Explicit

  researcher:
    triggers: ["research.task"]
    backend: "kiro"         # Has MCP tools for internal systems

  reviewer:
    triggers: ["review.request"]
    backend: "gemini"       # Different perspective
```

**Design decisions needed:**

| Question | Options |
|----------|---------|
| **Ralph's backend** | A: Config default, B: Always Claude, C: Separate config |
| **Inheritance** | Hat without `backend` inherits from `cli.backend` |
| **Custom inline** | Allow full backend config per hat, or just named backends? |

See `research/per-hat-backends.md` for full analysis.

**Answer: Full backend flexibility from day one**

Support three backend modes per hat:

```yaml
hats:
  # 1. Named backend (simple)
  builder:
    triggers: ["build.task"]
    backend: "claude"

  # 2. Kiro with custom agent (powerful)
  infra:
    triggers: ["infra.task"]
    backend:
      type: "kiro"
      agent: "infra-admin"  # Has AWS MCP tools

  # 3. Custom inline (full flexibility)
  compliance:
    triggers: ["compliance.check"]
    backend:
      command: "internal-compliance-agent"
      args: ["--strict"]
      prompt_mode: "stdin"
```

**Config schema:**

```rust
pub enum HatBackend {
    /// Named backend (claude, kiro, gemini, codex, amp)
    Named(String),

    /// Kiro with custom agent
    KiroAgent {
        agent: String,
        args: Option<Vec<String>>,
    },

    /// Fully custom backend
    Custom {
        command: String,
        args: Vec<String>,
        prompt_mode: PromptMode,
        prompt_flag: Option<String>,
    },
}
```

**What this enables:**

| Capability | How |
|------------|-----|
| Per-hat MCP servers | Kiro agents have their own `mcpServers` |
| Per-hat models | Different models per hat (Sonnet for coding, Haiku for research) |
| Per-hat tool permissions | Restrict write access for researcher |
| Mixed backends | Claude for coding, Gemini for review, Kiro for AWS |
| Internal tools | Custom backends for proprietary agents |

See `research/per-hat-backends.md` for full analysis including Kiro agent configuration reference.

## Research Complete ✅

See `research/current-implementation.md` for detailed findings.

**Key Implementation Insights:**

| Component | Current State | Change Needed |
|-----------|---------------|---------------|
| **Event Loop** | Routes to hats, fallback to planner hat | Fallback to hatless Ralph instead |
| **Hat Registry** | Custom hats replace defaults entirely | Ralph is separate, always present |
| **Event Parser** | Parses XML from output text | Replace with JSONL file reading |
| **Instructions** | `build_coordinator()` for planner hat | New `build_hatless_ralph()` method |
| **Config** | `HatConfig` has triggers/publishes | Add `default_publishes` field |

**Existing Infrastructure We Can Reuse:**
- Preflight validation (`preflight_check()`)
- Event routing logic (just change fallback)
- Core behaviors injection
- Topic pattern matching
