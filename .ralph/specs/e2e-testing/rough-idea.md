# Rough Idea: E2E Test Harness for Ralph

## Original Request

Create a test harness that invokes `ralph run` with real backends, starting with:
- Claude
- Kiro
- OpenCode

## Initial Context

This is an end-to-end testing solution that will exercise the full Ralph orchestration flow against actual AI backends, validating that the system works correctly in real-world conditions rather than just with mocked/recorded fixtures.
